# QA vs QC vs Testing

Understanding the difference between **Quality Assurance (QA)**, **Quality Control (QC)**, and **Testing** is one of the most important foundations for a QA professional.  
Although people sometimes use them interchangeably, they are **not the same**.

## 1. Quality Assurance (QA)

**Definition:**  
QA is about **processes**. It focuses on *preventing* defects before they occur by improving the way software is developed.

**Example in real life:**  
Think of a **restaurant kitchen**:  
- QA = Making sure the chefs follow hygiene rules, wear gloves, and keep the kitchen clean.  
- This doesn’t test the food directly — it ensures the process produces safe food.

**Example in software:**  
- Setting coding standards.  
- Reviewing requirement documents.  
- Following Agile best practices to avoid miscommunication.

**Keyword:** *Prevention*

## 2. Quality Control (QC)

**Definition:**  
QC is about the **product itself**. It focuses on *detecting* defects after development but before the product reaches the customer.

**Example in real life:**  
In the restaurant:  
- QC = The chef tastes the dish before serving it to ensure it’s cooked properly.  

**Example in software:**  
- Checking if the build meets requirements.  
- Inspecting a web application before deployment.  

**Keyword:** *Detection (before release)*

## 3. Testing

**Definition:**  
Testing is the actual process of **executing the software** to find defects. It’s one of the activities under QC.  

**Example in real life:**  
In the restaurant:  
- Testing = A customer tries the food and says, “This soup is too salty.”  

**Example in software:**  
- Running test cases on the login page.  
- Entering wrong password and checking if an error message appears.  

**Keyword:** *Execution*

## 4. Side-by-Side Comparison

| Aspect | QA (Quality Assurance) | QC (Quality Control) | Testing |
|--------|------------------------|----------------------|---------|
| Focus | **Process** | **Product** | **Execution** |
| Goal | Prevent defects | Detect defects | Find defects |
| When | During development | After development, before release | During testing phase |
| Who | Everyone (Dev, QA, PM, Business) | QA team | QA/Testers |
| Example | Code review process | Inspecting final build | Running login test cases |

## 5. Easy Analogy

Imagine a **car factory** :  
- QA = Ensuring the assembly line follows correct processes (safety checks, machine calibration).  
- QC = Inspecting a finished car for scratches or missing parts before delivery.  
- Testing = Driving the car to see if the brakes, steering, and lights work properly.

## Final Takeaway

- **QA ensures processes are right** → prevention.  
- **QC ensures product is right** → detection.  
- **Testing finds defects in the product** → execution.  

Together, QA + QC + Testing work as a **team** to deliver high-quality software.
