# TestRail Example

## What is TestRail?

**TestRail** is a web-based **test case management tool** used to organize, track, and manage software testing efforts.  
It helps QA teams create test cases, group them into test suites, execute test runs, and generate reports.  

TestRail provides a structured way to manage manual and automated tests and integrates with popular tools like **JIRA**, **GitHub**, **Jenkins**, and **Selenium**.

## TestRail Hierarchy

TestRail organizes testing in a structured way:

Project → Test Suites → Test Cases → Test Runs → Test Results

| Level | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Project** | Represents a complete product or module under test. |
| **Test Suite** | A collection of related test cases (e.g., Login Tests, Checkout Tests). |
| **Test Case** | Individual test that defines inputs, actions, and expected results. |
| **Test Run** | A group of test cases executed for a particular release or build. |
| **Test Result** | The outcome of an executed test case (Pass, Fail, Blocked, Retest). |

## Example: E-commerce Website in TestRail

### Project Name:
**E-commerce Web Application**

### Test Suites:
1. User Authentication  
2. Product Search  
3. Checkout and Payment

### Example Test Cases (Inside “User Authentication” Suite)

| Test Case ID | Title | Preconditions | Test Steps | Expected Result | Status |
|---------------|--------|----------------|-------------|-----------------|---------|
| TC-01 | Verify login with valid credentials | User account exists | 1. Navigate to login page <br> 2. Enter valid email and password <br> 3. Click Login | User should be redirected to homepage | Pass |
| TC-02 | Verify login with invalid password | User account exists | 1. Navigate to login page <br> 2. Enter valid email and wrong password <br> 3. Click Login | Error message “Invalid credentials” should appear | Fail |
| TC-03 | Verify reset password functionality | User account exists | 1. Click “Forgot Password” <br> 2. Enter registered email <br> 3. Click Submit | Password reset link should be sent to user’s email | Pass |

### Example Test Run

**Test Run Name:** E-commerce Login Module – Build 1.0  
**Executed By:** QA Team  
**Execution Date:** 05-Oct-2025  

| Test Case ID | Title | Result | Comments |
|---------------|--------|---------|-----------|
| TC-01 | Verify login with valid credentials | Pass | Working fine |
| TC-02 | Verify login with invalid password | Fail | No error message displayed |
| TC-03 | Verify reset password functionality | Pass | Verified on Gmail |

### Example Defect Linking (with JIRA Integration)

If a test fails, TestRail allows linking to a bug in JIRA or another defect tracker.

| Test Case ID | JIRA Defect ID | Description |
|---------------|----------------|-------------|
| TC-02 | BUG-145 | Error message missing for invalid login credentials |

---

## Reporting in TestRail

TestRail provides several built-in reports:
- Test run summary reports  
- Pass/fail rate by suite, milestone, or user  
- Defect summary reports (via integrations)  
- Progress and productivity charts  

**Example Summary:**

| Total Test Cases | Passed | Failed | Blocked | Retest |
