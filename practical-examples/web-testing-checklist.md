# Web Testing Checklist

This **Web Testing Checklist** helps QA engineers ensure that a web application is tested thoroughly before release. It covers functional, usability, compatibility, performance, and security testing areas in simple, easy-to-follow points.

---

## 1. Functional Testing

Check whether all functionalities of the website are working as expected.

### General Functionality
- Verify all links are working (internal, external, mailto).
- Validate that all buttons perform correct actions.
- Ensure forms (login, signup, contact, etc.) work correctly with valid and invalid inputs.
- Test file uploads and downloads.
- Verify pagination, sorting, and filtering features.
- Check error messages and success notifications are displayed properly.

### Form Validation
- Verify mandatory fields show appropriate error messages.
- Check field limits (max/min character count).
- Validate input types (email format, numbers, date, etc.).

### Navigation
- Ensure all menus and submenus work correctly.
- Check navigation flow between pages.
- Validate breadcrumb functionality if present.

## 2. UI and Usability Testing

Ensure the website is user-friendly and visually consistent.

- Verify layout alignment and spacing on all pages.
- Check text readability (font, color contrast, size).
- Test responsiveness on various screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile).
- Ensure all images are optimized and displayed correctly.
- Verify consistency in buttons, icons, and color themes.
- Confirm that all important elements are visible without scrolling (above the fold).

## 3. Compatibility Testing

Test the website across different browsers and devices.

- Browser Compatibility: Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari.
- Device Compatibility: Desktop, Tablet, Mobile.
- OS Compatibility: Windows, macOS, Android, iOS.
- Check website behavior on different screen resolutions.
- Verify that media elements (audio/video) load properly across browsers.

---

## 4. Performance Testing

Ensure the website performs efficiently under expected load conditions.

- Measure page load time — should be under 3 seconds for most pages.
- Check site performance during multiple simultaneous user sessions.
- Test caching and image compression efficiency.
- Validate database query performance for data-heavy pages.
- Monitor server response time.

---

## 5. Security Testing

Identify vulnerabilities that may expose user or business data.

- Verify login process (invalid password handling, session timeout).
- Ensure password encryption during transmission and storage.
- Test logout functionality (user session should end properly).
- Check for SQL injection, XSS (Cross-Site Scripting), and CSRF vulnerabilities.
- Validate that sensitive data (like passwords, card details) are not stored in plain text.
- Ensure HTTPS and valid SSL certificate are implemented.

---

## 6. Accessibility Testing

Make sure the website is accessible to all users, including those with disabilities.

- Check alt text for all images.
- Verify tab navigation works properly using the keyboard.
- Ensure ARIA labels are used where appropriate.
- Validate sufficient color contrast for readability.
- Test screen reader compatibility.

---

## 7. Content Testing

Ensure all visible and hidden content is correct and relevant.

- Verify there are no spelling or grammatical errors.
- Ensure contact details, links, and copyright are correct.
- Check that all images and videos are up to date.
- Validate that dynamic content loads properly (e.g., product listings, blog posts).

---

## 8. Database Testing

Check data integrity and consistency in the backend.

- Validate CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete).
- Ensure data is saved correctly after form submission.
- Test data rollback for failed transactions.
- Check database constraints and relationships.

---

## 9. SEO Testing

Make sure the website follows basic SEO guidelines.

- Check for unique and descriptive page titles.
- Verify meta descriptions and keywords for all pages.
- Ensure proper use of heading tags (H1, H2, etc.).
- Validate sitemap and robots.txt files.
- Test canonical URLs and proper redirects (301, 302).

---

## 10. Final Regression Checklist

Before release, recheck all major areas:

- Smoke test all key user journeys (login, add to cart, payment, logout).
- Verify all high-severity bugs are fixed and retested.
- Check UI on multiple devices one last time.
- Validate build version and environment details.
- Ensure test summary report is documented.

## Example Real-Life Scenario

Imagine you are testing an online food delivery website. Before launch, you would:

- Place a food order and ensure the total updates correctly.  
- Log in and check that past orders display properly.  
- Try using the site on a mobile device to confirm it’s responsive.  
- Enter invalid promo codes to ensure proper error handling.  
- Validate that the site uses HTTPS and no sensitive data is exposed.

This checklist ensures that the entire site — from design to backend — is verified for quality before release.
