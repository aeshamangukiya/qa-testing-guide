# Mobile Testing Checklist

This **Mobile Testing Checklist** helps QA engineers ensure that a mobile application (Android or iOS) is tested thoroughly before release. It covers functional, usability, compatibility, performance, security, and other critical areas.

## 1. Functional Testing

Check whether all features of the mobile app are working correctly.

### General Functionality
- Verify all buttons, links, and navigation elements work as expected.
- Validate forms (login, signup, contact, feedback) with valid and invalid data.
- Test push notifications and in-app alerts.
- Check file uploads/downloads (if applicable).
- Ensure all input fields accept the correct data type.
- Verify error and success messages are displayed correctly.

### App Navigation
- Test menus, tabs, and submenus for proper functionality.
- Ensure smooth navigation between screens.
- Validate back button and home button behavior.

## 2. UI and Usability Testing

Ensure the app is user-friendly and visually consistent.

- Verify layout and alignment across all screens.
- Check font size, readability, and color contrast.
- Ensure responsiveness on different screen sizes and orientations (portrait & landscape).
- Verify that images, icons, and videos load properly.
- Confirm consistency in buttons, icons, and themes.
- Ensure important elements are visible without excessive scrolling.

## 3. Compatibility Testing

Test the app on different devices, OS versions, and network conditions.

- Device Compatibility: Android (various versions), iOS (various versions).
- Screen Resolutions: Check small, medium, and large screens.
- Network Types: Wi-Fi, 3G, 4G, 5G, and offline mode.
- Check app behavior on different device brands and models.
- Validate OS upgrade/downgrade impact on app functionality.

---

## 4. Performance Testing

Ensure the mobile app performs efficiently under expected load conditions.

- Measure app launch time â€” should be quick and responsive.
- Monitor app responsiveness during multi-tasking.
- Test battery usage and memory consumption.
- Validate app behavior under low network conditions.
- Check for app crashes, freezes, or slow response.

---

## 5. Security Testing

Identify vulnerabilities and ensure user data protection.

- Validate login and authentication mechanisms.
- Test password encryption and secure storage.
- Check session timeout and logout functionality.
- Verify authorization and user access control.
- Test app behavior against malicious inputs and data injection attacks.
- Ensure HTTPS and secure API communication.

---

## 6. Accessibility Testing

Make sure the app is accessible to all users, including those with disabilities.

- Check screen reader compatibility.
- Ensure proper alt text for images and icons.
- Validate color contrast and font size for readability.
- Verify navigation through gestures and keyboard (if applicable).
- Test accessibility settings integration (Android/iOS).

---

## 7. Push Notifications and Alerts

- Validate notification delivery and content accuracy.
- Test tapping on notifications and navigation to correct screens.
- Check opt-in/opt-out functionality.
- Ensure notifications work when the app is in background or closed.

---

## 8. Database and Backend Testing

- Verify data consistency between app and server.
- Test data storage and retrieval.
- Validate CRUD operations for app data.
- Ensure synchronization between offline and online mode.

---

## 9. App Store Compliance

- Verify app meets Google Play Store / Apple App Store guidelines.
- Check app metadata, descriptions, screenshots, and versioning.
- Validate app permissions and privacy policies.

---

## 10. Final Regression Checklist

Before release, recheck all critical areas:

- Smoke test all main functionalities (login, payment, navigation, notifications).
- Ensure all high-severity bugs are fixed and retested.
- Check UI across multiple devices and orientations.
- Validate app version and build details.
- Confirm network behavior and offline scenarios.

---

## Example Real-Life Scenario

Imagine testing a food delivery mobile app before launch:

- Login and browse restaurants.
- Place an order and check total price calculation.
- Test push notifications for order status updates.
- Switch between Wi-Fi and mobile data to check performance.
- Test app on different devices and screen sizes for responsiveness.
- Ensure sensitive data (like payment info) is encrypted and secure.

This checklist ensures the mobile app is verified thoroughly from UI to backend before release.
